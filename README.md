Working with default libraries that come with python.

## Problem Statement
I make a lot fo cources. And i want to store the information about the courses

1. I need a database
2. We need a database table/model(values in our database)
3. Provide a command line utility function for manipulating our database.

This will give a good idea of Object Oriented Programming.
